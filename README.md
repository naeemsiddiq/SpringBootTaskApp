# Task App on Spring Boot

## Introduction
This app is a backend learning app on java spring boot which includes functionality of assigning Tasks to a user and that user can view tasks assigned to him and can set a reminder to get alert about the due date of task submission.

## `Components`
This app is built with certain essential components
  * Java Spring boot
  * Richardson Maturity Model(Level 1,2 and 3)
  * HATEOAS(level 3 of richardson model)
  * Exception Handling
  * Swagger
  * Hystrix with Hystrix Dashboard
  * Eureka server (naming server)
  * Hystrix Turbine

## `Richardson Maturity Model`
  * `steps toward the glory of REST`
A model that breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps. These introduce resources, http verbs, and hypermedia controls (HATEOAS)

## `Swagger`
Swagger UI allows anyone (be it your development team or your end consumers) to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.

## `Hystrix`
Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.

## `Eureka Server`
Eureka is a REST (Representational State Transfer) based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers. We call this service, the Eureka Server. Eureka also comes with a Java-based client component,the Eureka Client, which makes interactions with the service much easier.
